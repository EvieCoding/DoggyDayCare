# DoggyDayCare
Build a program that will have a menu with three options 1. check in dog, 2. check out dog, and 3. exit. This program required a class that included gets/ sets,  No args constructor, a constructor that takes in all information (i.e., name, owner name, age, breed, weight, color, and whether the owner provided food.), a method to determine the age of the dog, and a method to determine the size of the dog. The program itself allowed the user to pick an option to either check in or check out the dog and to exit the program when done. When the user exits the program, all dogs that werenâ€™t checked out for the day get written to a text file.
